Write a console application in C#, which

·       Print information about a car (car 1) with licence plate NF123456, 147 kW engine power, maximal speed of 200 km/h, green colour and type of personal vehicle

·       Print information about another car (car 2) with licence plate NF654321, 150 kW engine power, maximal speed of 195 km/h, blue colour and type of personal vehicle

·       Compare these two cars to check if this is the same vehicle

·       Print information about a plane with registration LN1234, 1000 kW engine power, 30m wingspan, 2t load capacity and 10t net weight, flying class of jet plane

·       Application should ask the plane to fly and print this

·       Print information about a boat with registration ABC123, 100 kW engine power, maximal speed of 30 knot per hour and 500 kg gross tonnage

By “printing” we mean output to a console.

Additional questions:

·       What would it take to replace console output with JSON file export?

·       What do you need to do in order to make this application and it’s classes testable?

Make a public Git repository on a service of your choice (GitHub, Bitbucket or any other) and send us the link back. Do not mention ABAX in the repository to avoid code to be searchable by other candidates.
